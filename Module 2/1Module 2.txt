Client can send message to other client by giving his name at the beginning of each message, i.e "clientname: message".
Client can add users using "add()" so that if the client sends message without the client name then the message will be gone to all the added clients.
Similarly client can remove using "remove()" clients from his/her group.
Client can exit using "exit()" or "quit()"
